      <p>OUr family has been blessed with wonderful pets over the past 6 years, with Addie being their great caretaker.
        <br><br>
        What follows is a brief description of the Lewis' pets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - Addie: Our first true animal we had living in our house. Part cat, part human.</li>
        <li><strong>2012</strong> - Mr. Myagi: We picked him from the pound in Rota, Spain. He was a quiet, shy little
          guy. The second we got him back to the house he showed his true colors; bright red, with horns!</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong> - Izzy: The wildest of the bunch, not sure which species; possibly monkey?</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong> - Precious: She truly was precious, black as night, but a heart of gold.</li>
        <li><strong>2014</strong> - Tigre: A beautiful cat, striped like a tiger. He also had the instinct of a tiger,
          and occasionally hunted Izzy.</li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong> - Beau: Saved by my beautiful wife; Beau was a wonderful dog. Although he had the most
          audible tounge; he was a sweetheart.</li>
        <li><strong>2017</strong> - The Barn Cats: I don't remember their names, but Addie does! Addie was their master; the head of their clan.</li>
      </ul>
